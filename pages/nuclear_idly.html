      <h2>Recipe:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Vada Batter:
          <ul>
            <li>Wash and soak the chana dal in water for 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain the soaked dal and grind it into a coarse paste without adding too much water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ground dal, mashed potato, chopped onion, green chilies, curry leaves, ginger-garlic paste, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and salt. Mix well.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Shape and Fry the Volcano Vada:
          <ul>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Take a small portion of the vada mixture and shape it into a ball. Make an indentation in the center to resemble a crater.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the shaped vada into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Tamarind Lava Sauce:
          <ul>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine tamarind pulp, jaggery or brown sugar, red chili powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes a lava-like consistency. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the Volcano Vada:
          <ul>
            <li>Place the fried vada on a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the tamarind lava sauce over the vada, allowing it to flow down the sides like molten lava.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add the Volcanic Ash:
          <ul>
            <li>Sprinkle black sesame seeds over the vada to resemble volcanic ash, adding a unique texture and visual appeal.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
